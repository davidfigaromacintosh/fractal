# A simple C++ program that draws fractals!

The program can generate following fractal sets:
* The Mandelbrot Set Z^2
* The Mandelbrot Set Z^3
* The Mandelbrot Set Z^4
* The Burning Ship

I'm going to add more sets in the future.

## How to build and run:
1. Make sure you have already installed the following libraries:
* libsdl2-2.0
* libsdl2-dev
* g++-multilib
#
2. Enter the terminal and type the following command:

`g++ main.cpp -o fractal -lstdc++ -lm -lSDL2`
#
3. Run the program:

`./fractal`
